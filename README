Integrated Breeding Platform (Accessible cutting-edge crop breeding tools and services)

https://www.integratedbreeding.net/

In the last decade, a private sector-led 'gene revolution' has boosted crop productivity in developed countries, by applying 
and combining the latest advances in molecular biology and information technology with accurate plant phenotyping. In contrast, 
molecular breeding adoption is still limited in the public sector, and hardly used at all in developing countries. 
Major bottlenecks in these countries include shortage of well-trained personnel, inadequate infrastructure and lack of 
information systems with adaptable analysis tools.

The IBP is envisioned as a one-stop-shop for information, analytical tools and related services to design and carry out 
integrated breeding projects. IBP will boost crop productivity and resilience for smallholders in drought-prone environments 
by exploiting the economies of scale afforded by collective access to cutting-edge breeding technologies and informatics 
hitherto unavailable to developing country breeders.

The Generation Challenge Programme (GCP) of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is 
building the IBP in collaboration with 14 initial user cases - breeding projects for eight crops across thirty-two 
developing countries in Africa and Asia. This ensures IBP development is driven by real breeder needs and its interface 
is user-friendly. IBP is proposed to open up to additional users from 2012, with full unfettered access scheduled for 2014.
